## aix search

Search for resources across cached repositories

### Synopsis

Search for skills, commands, agents, and MCP servers across all cached repositories.

The search is case-insensitive and matches against resource names and descriptions.
Results are sorted by match quality: exact name matches first, then prefix matches,
then substring matches, then description-only matches.

If no query is provided, all resources are listed (subject to filters).

```
aix search [query] [flags]
```

### Examples

  # Search for resources containing "deploy"
  aix search deploy

  # Search for skills only
  aix search --type=skill

  # Search in a specific repository

  # Output as JSON

  # List all resources
